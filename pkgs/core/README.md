I also refer to various literature on the Internet and exchanges on Q&A sites such as Stackoverflow, and when I know the source, I write the URL of the page in the `// SEE:` comment.

And un addition, some of the code includes code generated by ChatGPT and Github Copilot, and as far as I have noticed, `// Author: ChatGPT` and ` Comments such as // Author: Github Copilot` are clearly indicated.

Thank you ðŸ«°ðŸ«°ðŸ«°
